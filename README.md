## Image-Captioning

In this project, our model tries to predict a caption based on the image given.
We used flickr8k dataset for our training and testing purposes.
We start with predicting the objects inside an image using CNN.
We then use RNN to predict a caption for that image.

The folder image captioning.pynb contains the code.The screenshots contains the output of some trained images.

Tools: CNN,RNN,transfer learning,resnet-50
